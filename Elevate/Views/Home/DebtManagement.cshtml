        <h1 class="my-4">Debt Management</h1>
        <p>Debt management involves strategies to manage and repay debt effectively, aiming to improve financial health. 
           It typically starts with budgeting, which helps prioritize essential spending while ensuring consistent payments toward debts. 
           Debt consolidation is another option, combining multiple debts into one loan with a lower interest rate. 
           Common repayment strategies include the Debt Snowball, which focuses on paying off smaller debts first, 
           and the Debt Avalanche, which targets high-interest debts to save on long-term interest. Avoiding new debt
           and building an emergency fund are crucial steps in staying financially secure while managing debt responsibly.</p>
