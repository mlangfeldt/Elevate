        <h1 class="my-4">Budgeting</h1>
        <p>Budgeting is the process of creating a plan to manage income and expenses effectively.
        It involves tracking your earnings, setting aside funds for essential costs like housing,
        utilities, and groceries, and allocating money for savings or debt repayment. By developing
        a budget, individuals can gain control over their finances, avoid overspending, and work toward
        financial goals such as paying off debt or building an emergency fund. A well-structured budget
        helps ensure financial stability and reduces stress by providing a clear overview of spending habits and future financial needs.</p>
