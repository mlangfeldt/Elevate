        <h1 class="my-4">Retirement</h1>
        <p>Retirement is the phase of life where individuals stop working full-time and rely on savings,
            investments, or pensions to support themselves. It involves careful planning to ensure
            financial stability in later years, typically through saving in retirement accounts like
            401(k)s or IRAs, maximizing Social Security benefits, and managing post-retirement expenses.
            Effective retirement planning includes understanding future income needs, investment strategies,
            and healthcare considerations to maintain a desired lifestyle without active employment.
            Preparing for retirement early can provide greater financial security and peace of mind during this stage of life.</p>
